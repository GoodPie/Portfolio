			<p>I love exploring new things, no matter what the subject matter is. I believe that's driven me to where I am today
				and is what has allowed me to adapt to whatever has been thrown at me very well.</p>

			<p class='mt-3'>
				Whilst I love working on the front end, as you can probably tell by this website, design is not my strong point.
				I am however, taking action and currently undertaking a course and using all the resources at my disposal to get
				better. Hopefully by the time you have visited this site, I would have put some of that to practice.
				Give me a design document though and I'll bring that bad boy to life.

				Also, as cliche as it sounds, I am here to help people. My whole career up to this point has been aimed at
				providing whatever services I can to those in need whether that be my several years spent as a support worker
				with Autism QLD and Endeavour or to my current role here at Consent2Go. Life is short and sometimes unfair. Why not do what I
				can to improve it?
